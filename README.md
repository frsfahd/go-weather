# go-weather

[Restful weather API](https://roadmap.sh/projects/weather-api-wrapper-service) based on [virtual crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) service. This project adds cache layer to the based API.

Additionally, there is also performance testing with [k6](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/) (see `load_test.js` and `smoke_test.js`)
